Description: A class of frequently used Bayesian parametric and nonparametric model structures,as well as tools for the analytical tasks. Structures include Gaussian and Normal-Inverse-Wishart conjugate structure, Gaussian and Normal-Inverse-Gamma conjugate structure, Categorical and Dirichlet conjugate structure, Dirichlet Process on positive integers, Dirichlet Process in general, Hierarchical Dirichlet Process ... Tasks include updating posteriors, calculating marginal likelihood, calculating posterior predictives, calculating MAP estimates ...
